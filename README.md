# FAQ
### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, I was solving data structure problems for this project, understanding the project requirements and implementing data structure to use for the purpose of the project. In C++ language, thinking of Vector, Hash Table and Tree data structures each having their advantages and disadvantages to store data and utilize.
### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached it with mindset that it will be used and altered, updated in future. From this, I thought of what data structures will be easy to use now and in the future to store data and use them. Depending on project requirements, data can be not complex in nature and simpler data structures can be used without thinking of positives and negatives.
### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were plenty of roadblocks while going through activities and project. Each one was overcame with persistence, critical thinking. I needed to restudy C++ again because there were some libraries I needed to use and I had forgotten the language after not using it for a long time.
### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Programming language is always changing, updating and new libraries are being created and added to make programming simpler. If this were years ago, it would have been much difficult to overcome roadblocks on this project. 
### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I add more comments than ever to my codes to make them easier to understand not just by me but others. Using adaptable codes by using less hard codes and using more functions so they can be edited, utilized in future much easier without having to write new code. No hard variable writing with string or integers.
